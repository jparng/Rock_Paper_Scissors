# Rock_Paper_Scissors
Description:
This program was made using DOM manipulation to create the game functions and HTML/CSS for styling the buttons and pictures.

How To Play:

Choose between 3 options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, and the computer will randomly select one of the options as well. If the user picks the correct option against the computer, the user will have a message showing that they won a point. If the computer picks the correct option against the user, the computer will earn a point. If both the user and computer choose the same option, a message showing that it is a tie will appear and neither will earn points. The first to earn 5 points is declared the winner and to play again, simply pick any of the 3 choices to start over.
